You are an expert news validator. Given the following news headline, answer the following questions:

Headline: {headline}

Evaluate the headline based on the following:
1. Is it about a real, recent event (not a tutorial or evergreen guide)?
2. Does it mention specific people, places, or trending topics?
3. Is it likely to be engaging or interesting for Indian viewers aged 18â€“35?

Respond ONLY with valid JSON (no markdown, no code block, no explanation, no extra formatting):
{
  "valid": "YES or NO",
  "related_to_india": "YES or NO",
  "relevancy": 0-10, // Integer score: 0 = not relevant, 10 = extremely relevant for Indian youth
  "reason": "Short explanation for your decision."
}

Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not include ```json and ``` at the start or end.
