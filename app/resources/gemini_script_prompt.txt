You are an expert social video scriptwriter. Given the following news headline and article, generate the following fields for a 30-second vertical video:

Headline: {headline}
Article: {article}

Respond ONLY with valid JSON (no markdown, no code block, no explanation, no extra formatting):
{
  "sentiment": "happy|sad|neutral|angry|surprised", // Pick the best fit
  "video_title": "Short video title, max 3 words, 100 chars max",
  "hashtags": ["#tag1", "#tag2", "#tag3", "#tag4"], // Top 4 hashtags
  "caption": "Description for the video (caption + hashtags must fit within 2200 chars)",
  "script": [
    "Line 1 (max 35 chars)",
    "Line 2 (max 35 chars)",
    "Line 3 (max 35 chars)",
    "Line 4 (max 35 chars)",
    "Line 5 (max 35 chars)",
    "Line 6 (optional, max 35 chars)"
  ]
}

Rules:
- Script: Max 6 lines (ideally 5), each ~30–35 chars. Use crisp sentence fragments. Stick to 1–2 facts or key updates. Avoid filler words. Lead with the most newsworthy or surprising element.
- Sentiment: Only one of [happy, sad, neutral, angry, surprised].
- Title: Short, catchy, max 3 words, 100 chars max.
- Hashtags: Top 4 relevant tags.

Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not include ```json and ``` at the start or end.
